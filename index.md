Back-end Engineering is my speciality and passion. I build api and apps with complex requirements. I know we don't build views inside back-end anymore, but we separate front-end (client-side) from back-end (api) and tests are very very important for quality. I use Slack/Hangout, Bitbucket/GitHub, Bamboo/Travis, Jira/Pivotal.
