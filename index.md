### Professional Summary

Full Stack developer with 13 years of experience delivering successful products. At my last company (Techifide), I was responsible for building an API service for a BIM system that was awarded at the British market in London for its expressive results. At Profile Design I built a system to monitor traffic accidents for the government and this system has been used for several companies to avoid new accidents.

As a temporary worker, the most recent product I’ve created is an Elixir/Phoenix API that uses DynamoDB and Recognition systems from Amazon to avoid financial cheats for a Fintech company based in Brazil (http://useniq.com).

I am also glad to show my first Book on Elixir and my most recent certification on Graph Databases:
