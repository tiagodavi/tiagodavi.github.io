### Professional Summary

Back-End Developer with 13 years of experience delivering successful products. At my last company (Techifide), I was a Node JS Developer responsible for building API services using Node JS/RXJS/Express/OrientDB for two main projects and one of them called "BIM" was awarded at the British market in London for its expressive results. At Profile Design I built a system to monitor traffic accidents for the government and this system has been used for several companies to avoid new accidents until now.

Currently I work for a financial company as an Elixir Developer using Elixir/Phoenix to build financial products such as Bank as a Service and Fraud Detection.

I am also glad to show my first Book on Elixir and my most recent certification on Graph Databases:
