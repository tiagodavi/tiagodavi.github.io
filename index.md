### Professional Summary

Backend Developer with more than 10 years of relevant working experience. I am able to create apps from scratch as well as deploy them to production.

What makes me different are my results. I've built more than 30 projects from scratch and put them to production, some of them under budget. I was able to save money moving two big systems from shared host to only one single host on cloud, customers are very happy because of it. At one of my previous jobs, I was selected to become the Tech Lead because of my hard work and dedication. One project that I helped create when I was Tech Lead was awarded in England. I also have written a book, and I am really proud of it.

I am looking for a stable company where I can continue my career as Backend Developer if possible working with languages such as either Elixir, JavaScript, Ruby or Python. Please take a look at my Github Account because I have several projects there, most of them using TDD and the best practices for software engineering.
